Park-o-Sphere Backend
=====================
This is the REST service to support the front-end for the Park-o-Sphere
web site.


Quick Start for Development
---------------------------

###Requirements:
* (Optional) homebrew: http://brew.sh - if you are working on a Mac, this will make it easy to install the other requirements.  
  If you're on Linux, you already have a package manager so use that.
  If you're on Windows, I don't have any clue how you would run this package.
* Python 2.7: http://www.python.org 
  (brew install python / sudo apt-get install python)
* pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip 
  (already included if you do a brew install python / sudo apt-get install python-pip)
* sqlite 3: http://www.sqlite.org
  (brew install sqlite / sudo apt-get install sqlite3)
* foreman: https://github.com/ddollar/foreman

###First Run:
* pip install virtualenv
* git clone [git@github.com:freedomgamees/parklab.git](git@github.com:freedomgamees/parklab.git])
* cd parklab
* virtualenv venv
* source venv/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt
* pip install -r test-requirements.txt
* PYTHONPATH=backend/src DATABASE\_URL=sqlite:///test.db python backend/src/backend/create\_db.py
* foreman start -e .env\_dev

The REST service is now available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

###Subsequent Runs:
* cd parklab (if you aren't there already)
* source venv/bin/activate (if your shell has not already sourced this file)
* pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt 
  (if requirements.txt has changed and you need to install new requirements)

* rm -f backend/src/backend/test.db; PYTHONPATH=backend/src DATABASE\_URL=sqlite:///test.db python backend/src/backend/create\_db.py
  (if the db schema has changed and you need to recreate the database but don't feel like doing a migration)
* foreman start -e .env\_dev

The REST service exposes three resources and supports returning JSON or html for GETs.
